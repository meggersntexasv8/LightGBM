Python Package Example
=====================
Here is an example for LightGBM to use python package.

***You should install lightgbm (both c++ and python verion) first.***

For the installation, check the wiki [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM/wiki/Installation-Guide).

You also need scikit-learn and pandas to run the examples, but they are not required for the package itself. You can install them with pip:
```
pip install -U scikit-learn
pip install -U pandas
```

Now you can run examples in this folder, for example:
```
python simple_example.py
```
