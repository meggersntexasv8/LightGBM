LightGBM, Light Gradient Boosting Machine
==========

LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that using tree based learning algorithms. It is designed to be distributed and high performance, and has following advantages:

- Fast training speed
- Low memory consumption
- Better accuracy
- Efficient parallel learning
- Can learn from very big data

For the details about these advantages, please refer to [Feature Highlight](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM/wiki/Feature-Highlight).

The [experiments](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM/wiki/Experiments#comparison-experiment) on real data also show LightGBM can outperform other existing boosting tools on both learning efficiency and accuracy, with much lower memory consumption. And LightGBM can achieve linear speed-up for parallel learning in our [experiments](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM/wiki/Experiments#parallel-experiment).
