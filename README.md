LightGBM, Light Gradient Boosting Machine
==========

LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that using tree based learning algorithms. It is designed to be distributed and efficient with following advantages:

- Fast training efficiency
- Low memory usage
- Better accuracy
- Parallel learning supported
- Deal with large scale of data

For the details, please refer to [Feature Highlights](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM/wiki/Feature-Highlight).

The [experiments](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM/wiki/Experiments#comparison-experiment) on the public data also shows that LightGBM can outperform other existing boosting tools on both learning efficiency and accuracy, with significant lower memory consumption. What's more, the [experiments](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM/wiki/Experiments#parallel-experiment) shows that LightGBM can achieve linear speed-up by using multiple machines for training in specific settings.
